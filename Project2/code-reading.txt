1. Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161?
  Register 29

2. What bus/busses does OS/161 support?
  LAMEbus

3. What is the difference between splhigh and spl0?
  splhigh() sets the spl (set priority level) to the highest value and all interrupts are disabled
  spl0() set the spl to 0 and all interrupts are enabled

4. Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying "int"? 
  We want to specify the size (32-bits) unsigned integer.

5. What does splx return?
 It returns the old interrupt state.

6. What is the highest interrupt level?
 15

7. How frequently are hardclock interrupts generated?
 100 times per second

8. What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device?
    - The functions d_open, d_close, d_io, d_ioctl comprise the interface to a VFS device

9. How many characters are allowed in a volume name?
  32

10. How many direct blocks does an SFS file have?
  15

11. What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e., what functions must you implement to implement a new file system)?
 fs_sync, fs_getvolanme, fs_getroot, fs_umount

12. What function puts a thread to sleep?
 thread_sleep()

13. How large are OS/161 pids?
  OS/161 pids are 32 bits or 4 bytes in size

14. What operations can you do on a vnode?
    On a vnode you can open, close, reclaim, read, readlink, getdirentry, write, ioctl, stat, gettype, tryseek, fsync, mmap, truncate, namefile, create, symlink, mkdir, link, remove, rmdir, rename, lookup, lookparent ( vop_open, vop_close, vop_reclaim, vop_read, vop_readlink, vop_getdirentry, vop_write, vop_ioctl, vop_stat, vop_gettype, vop_tryseek, vop_fsync, vop_mmap, vop_truncate, vop_namefile, vop_creat, cop_symlink, vop_mkdir, vop_link, vop_remove, vor_rmdir, vop_rename, vop_lookup, vop_lookparent) 

15. What is the maximum path length in OS/161?
  1024

16. What is the system call number for a reboot?
  #define SYS_reboot 8

17. Where is STDIN_FILENO defined?
  kern/include/kern/unistd.h

18. Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not?
   Yes, the schedular creates the run queue and the thread system initializes the first thread

19. What is a zombie?
 A zombie is a thread or process that has been exited but not deleted
 
20. How large is the initial run queue?
  32 
21. What does a device name in OS/161 look like?
   Name of device is device

22. What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like?
   The name with raw appended
 
23. What lock protects the vnode reference count?
    vn_countlock lock protects the vnode reference count

24. What device types are currently supported?
    Block and character devices are currently supported
